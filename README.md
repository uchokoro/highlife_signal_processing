ABSTRACT
From the ancient to the modern, African Music employs a wide variety of percussion and melo-rhythmic instruments. The characteristic rhythms of the different genres of African Music are intimately linked to the very essence and being of Africans, and elicit spontaneous response(s) from them in the form of smiles, singing, clapping, dance, and other body movements. With modern developments in audio technology, African popular musicians employ various audio signal processors in the course of their performances, whether live or recorded. Such signal processing, if not properly managed, could create discontinuity between the performers’ sonic-rhythmic intentions and expression on one hand, and the audience’s sonic-rhythmic experiences and perception on the other. Using empirical research, this paper investigates the effects of audio signal processing on the authenticity of rhythm(s) in African popular music, as perceived by the audience. It focuses on the effects of equalization on the rhythmic perception of Highlife music in the Niger Delta.
